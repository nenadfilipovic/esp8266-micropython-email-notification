# ESP8266 Micropython email notification

Building basic email notification system for esp8266 boards.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/nenadfilipovic/esp8266-micropython-email-notification
```

### Prerequisites

For this to work you will need to download micropython image from http://micropython.org/download and flash it to esp8266 board.
You will also need esptool to be able to flash image to board.

### Installing

First install esptool form pip.

```
pip install esptool
```

Then erase your esp8266 board.
Which port you use depends what operating system you are using.

```
MAC OS - esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
```

or

```
WINDOWS OS - esptool.py --port COM4 erase_flash
```

After you connect board to PC go to 'Device Manager' and under 'Ports' find at which port is your board connected.

If there is no device connected you need to install serial drivers from

https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/assets/_site_/downloads/CH34x_Install_Windows_v3_4.zip.

Then you will be able to deploy firmware to esp8266 board.

```
esptool.py -p COM4 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 /Users/You/Downloads/esp8266â€“20170612-v1.9.1.bin
```

Now connect to your esp8266 board with Putty or some other terminal program and check if board greets you with micropython terminal.
